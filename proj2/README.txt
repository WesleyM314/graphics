Project 2
Wesley Miller

Run 'make' command in proj2 directory to compile.

Run ./proj2 to start the program, then follow the menu 
prompt to view the 8-ball or load a PLY file. 

Place any PLY or DATA files in the proj2 directory.

Note: After selecting a menu option, the focus shifts
to the OpenGL window. Just go back to the terminal
window to enter a file name.
